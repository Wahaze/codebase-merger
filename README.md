# codebase-merger
A Python script to merge your project's entire code base into a single text file: you will get all the codes from all files in one. It recursively scans directories, intelligently ignoring dependencies (e.g., node_modules) and build artifacts. Ideal for creating a complete snapshot for archiving or feeding your project's code to an AI for analysis.
